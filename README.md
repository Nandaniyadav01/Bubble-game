# Bubble Hit Game

This project is a web-based bubble hit game. The game challenges players to click on bubbles containing the target number displayed at the top. Players earn points by correctly hitting the target number within a limited time.

## Description

The Bubble Hit Game is an interactive game where players need to click on bubbles that match the target number displayed. The target number changes each time a correct bubble is clicked, and a new set of bubbles is generated. The game includes a timer, and the player's score is displayed. The game ends when the timer runs out or when an incorrect bubble is clicked.
